## Gripes with ATM3
* Too many mods. -Don
* Make yellorium spawn (reduced?) -Isa
	* This is how you would respond, with a tab. -You

## Discussion
* could just make sure the villages spawn them[smelteries] correctly? its a config option / capqu
	* Yeah, that works. -Isa
* Re: Draconic Evolution: Check how hard it is to make things in ATM3, even the chest requires a shitload of fuck. I'm not sure it actually isn't imbalanced in hardmode. Theo and Don aren't using it even though they considered it because it's so gay to even make the chest, but then again, if it is that tedious in hardmode then maybe it's not worth adding. - Isa
	* yea in atm3 it seemed fine, aside from the shit it adds to tcon obv
* How do we feel about TechReborn? -isa
